## JEDHA PROJECT INFORMATION. DEEP LEARNING 

## AT&T Spam Detector

Build a spam detector that can automatically flag spams as they come, based solely on the sms content.<br>
The dataset contains messages classified as "spams" and "hams".
<br>
Tip :
The dataset is small (5566 lines), transfer learning from a sophisticated model trained on a lot more data might help !

Deliverables :
- A notebook with all necessary preprocessing and one or more Deep Learning models to predict the spam or ham nature of messages.
- Clearly state the achieved performance

Libraries used :
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Transformers
