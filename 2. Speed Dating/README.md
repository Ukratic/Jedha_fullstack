## Speed Dating

Explore a dataset from a speed dating experiment from 2002-2004. <br>
During the events, attendees had a short "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. They then had to say if they would like to see their date again and were asked to rate their date on six attributes :<br>
Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.<br>
The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process.

The notebook should include :
- Descriptive statistics
- Visualizations
- Captions and interpretations on how the 2 are relevant to why people agree (or not) to a second date

Libraries used:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
