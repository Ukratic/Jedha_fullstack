## JEDHA PROJECT INFORMATION. SUPERVISED ML

## Walmart Weekly Sales

Build a machine learning model able to estimate weekly sales in Walmart stores.<br>
The dataset contains information about weekly sales by different Walmart stores and other variables such as unemployment rate and fuel price. The dataset has been taken from a Kaggle competition but some changes were made compared to original data.

Three steps :
- Make an EDA and all necessary preprocessings to the data for machine learning
- Train a linear regression model to establish a baseline
- Fight overfitting by training a regularized regression model

Models used :
Linear regression, Ridge, Lasso

Tools & metrics :
R2 score, KNN Imputer, Grid Search cross validation

Visualization libraries :
Seaborn, Matplotlib
